Hello, denizens of <address>!

It's me, Trashy the Robot, reminding you that trash trucks are coming by tomorrow!

It's 9pm Tuesday, so you should take the trash out RIGHT NOW! Yes, you! Do it! Move your ass, go out and take out the trash.

Whoever does it first gets free candy.


Love and trash,

Trashy the Robot
